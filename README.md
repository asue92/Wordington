Wordington is a clone of the popular game Wordle, but is more secure in that the answers are not stored in an array that can be easily inspected.

You have six tries to guess the 5 letter word, which is served up randomly by the Random Word API every time the game begins.

Each guess is verified by the Word Dictionary API.
